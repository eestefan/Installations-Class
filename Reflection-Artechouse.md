Artechouse is a new museum dedicated to exhibiting interactive art. The space is located in the heart of South Beach, a city thriving with international tourism, giving this new space and the works within potential international visibility.

What is Interactive Art? As described on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_art#cite_note-:0-4),
“Interactive art is a form of art that involves the spectator in a way that allows the art to achieve its purpose. Some interactive art installations achieve this by letting the observer or visitor "walk" in, on, and around them; some others ask the artist or the spectators to become part of the artwork. [Taken from Soler-Adillon, Joan (2015-12-21). "The intangible material of interactive art: agency, behavior and emergence". Artnodes. 0 (16). doi:10.7238/a.v0i16.2744. ISSN 1695-5951.]
 
XYZT is a progressive and current exhibition featuring several large- and small-scale integrative artworks by the artists Adrien M & Claire B.

The bio for Adrien M & Claire B and their works found on the Artechouse https://miami.artechouse.com website explains that the artists’ company “creates digital and living art forms, ranging from stage performance to installations…[and] combines the real and virtual world with IT tools…They strive to create living digital art: mobile, handcrafted, short-lived, and responsive.” 

I am not yet well versed in this field of art and all the technologies that are used in this show and works like it. But my experience is something I can surely share.

I was mesmerized and elated upon entering the museum space. The installation filled the entire museum space on two floors. It was transformed giving the feeling of entering another workd, yet familiar. 

On the first floor, the darkly lit room was illuminated and filled with life size black and white digital works. Works icluded what looked like a sea of grass below my feet that moved as I walked across it, moving as if my mass and steps produced wind. In turn the digital blades of grass moved with and away from me, like dropping a pebble in water producing waves of reaction. Another another piece gave a funhouse mirror effect that transformed my likeness, but not just distorting it, rather playing with it. My reflection swirled with and away from me in a delayed form. The second floor while housing another life size piece, also introduced smaller scale works.

As a whole, the pieces seemed to have a connection with the natural world, very organic in nature and feel.
