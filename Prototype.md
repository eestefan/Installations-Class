Prototype, Play with Me and We: Reflection Wall

With much thanks to Prof. Zeven Rodriguez!

The concept started with the idea of playing with one’s shadow—creating a shadow wall of sorts. I even heard a theme song in my head “Dancing with Myself” by Billy Idol. [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG1NrQYXjLU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG1NrQYXjLU)

The idea was to be able to see a projection of one’s own shadow on a large wall. As you move around your shadow follows you, but sometimes it might run away from you—so go chase it. It is meant to be playful and enjoyable for all ages. 

I imagined it would need projection and mapping, some fun concepts tools discussed in my Installations class. I was dazzled. But I am fairly new to creative coding and in the early stages of learning. I am an ameba. 

So, where to begin?

Start with the basics, from pie in the sky to the a-b-c’s. The coding process was a long one. It just seemed to flash by me in a dizzying swirl. I think it jumped from JavaScript, then p5.js and landed in processing. (Pardon any faux pas you may find with my tech jargon; again, I am just an ameba at this stage.) 

The plan was to capture stills of the audience moving about and play it back in a quick video. A quick video intro—something to cue the audience, would start it off.

There were many bumps along the way. And oh, so much help and tutoring were needed. But it moved along, slowly but surely. Issues included the images not capturing, then they were saving in the wrong folder for the playback. The intro video clip would not show but there were no code errors popping up. And the playback code—what? And so it went on.

Aside from coding woes, experimenting with filters to give a showdown like effect was a fun part of the journey. Ultimately the threshold filter was used. Modifying the intensity minimizes line and detail making the projection shadowlike. 

While playing with projection, another consideration was whether to have the projection in front of or behind the audience. (This was another fine experience.) Projecting in front of the audience gives a hand puppet affect. While projecting behind the audience projects the person plus a shadow. So, it looks more like a double shadow. 

It finally came together. It is rough and in the early stages, but it is off to a good start. 

A quick vintage movie countdown with “Action” starts it off. The participant then moves about, then the video plays back. You can start it over and the images add on, so the video gets longer. It is fun to watch. 

This continues to be a work in progress, The visuals need to be refined and made more appealing. Work on the filter and projection need more consideration. So, it will continue to evolve.

To be continued…
