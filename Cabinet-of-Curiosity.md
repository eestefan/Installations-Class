# Cabinet of Curiosity, Within by Elizabeth Estefan

My cabinet started with the idea that I surround myself with all sorts of notes, lists and reminders in notebooks, on little pieces of scrap paper, sticky notes, and on my phone with alarms. I even buy magnets with quotes. Some notes are short lived while others stick around for years. These notes can include mundane daily errands, a PMS color for collateral I maybe creating, or a mantra or quote to help remind me of who I am, who I aspire to be or how to live in the moment.

So how would I display this collection. I thought of collecting notes on a board, but it started to transform. Maybe it would be a life size head shape with the notes all around it or maybe inside in a clutter.

Then thinking back to some of my older works, I played a lot with the concept of dolls or small humanoid objects as a reflection of self. This in part came from the relationship with my dolls and stuffed animals as a child, which most children probably share. Looking back, it was as if I would breathe life into them. They had names, personalities and stories of their own. I loved them. And ultimately, they were a reflection of the stories and dreams within me. 

Further former works included garments for these “dolls” I was creating. It seemed appropriate to share my notes, my reminders with a new garment.

I initially thought about adding the notes to the exterior of the garment, as a representation of the things people plainly see or think they see and know about others the meet in passing or superficially acquainted. Then in reading some of notes, including mantras and quotes I have around me at work and home, it turned into something more intimate.

I instead decided to add the notes to the interior of the garment, a way to protect what others do not easily see or know about me. These are notes I hold on to more tightly, who I am, who I aspire to be and how to be in the moment.
