Visited June 27, 2019.

The Perez Art Museum of Miami (PAMM) is a large museum housing modern and contemporary art in its two-story indoor and outdoor exhibition space. PAMM’s home of Downtown Miami, which is a hub for national and international tourism and business, gives the museum and its exhibitions international visibility.

*American Echo Chamber* is an installation by José Carlos Martinat in PAMM’s double-height gallery. The dark as night room has high ceilings, yet is intimate size, allowing for the installation to fully surround the audience.

Upon entering I was enveloped and captivated by large shapes, lights and sounds which gave me a feeling of delight. I was captivated with a childlike curiosity by the ever-changing light patterns and colors coming from the moving and static large LED sculptures surrounding me, above me hanging from the ceiling, at my feet lined up against the walls and in front of me in the center of the room. Speakers projected what sound to me like wind chime jingling sounds giving me a visualization of what metal tinsel rattling together may project.

The vibrantly glowing sculptures distracted me from seeing what was in front of me. Not until I started to see past the mystifying display, did I started to see these light sculptures take shape. I slowly started to recognize the subjects—dark and violent imagery such as a butchered woman on the floor, men in nooses hanging from the ceiling and a Confederate flag right above my head. What I once perceived as a playful and enchanting, hit me with a sobering breath. Even the wind chimes now sounded chillingly eerie.

PAMM describes Martinat’s work as “an installation that responds to the amplification and reinforcement of ideas in the current social and political landscape.” I appreciate Martinat juxtaposition of playful elements with dark subject matter. I feel the playfulness of the art is a clever way to lure in then confront the audience with current realities. This installation feels relevant today with fake news and the appalling what seems approval of racism, social and environmental injustice by some top governmental officials.
