Playing with S.J.
Supersizing Social Justice through Games

Concept Introduction: What is Social Justice? 
“Institutions in society should allow equal opportunities to all people without engaging in discrimination. Social Injustices occur when a person, people or groups of people are treated unfairly based upon a certain characteristic of that person or group of people such as race (racism), age (ageism), gender (sexism), religion and sexuality (heterosexism). 
~Social Justice Lesson for Kids: Definition, Issues & Examples, Chapter 17, Lesson 6. https://study.com/academy/lesson/social-justice-lesson-for-kids-definition-issues-examples.html

The installation is inspired by the social justice boardgames in the Kislak Center at the University of Miami’s Special Collections. https://www.library.miami.edu/kislak-center/about.html And is to be presented in collaboration with the Kislak Center, School of Comm Interactive Media Program and the Miami Law. 

Games in the Kislak Center collection include: 

What shall I be? the exciting game of career girls. 1966 (Career opportunities for the modern woman.)
Selchow & Righter Company; The Bookshop LLC, bookseller;
Bay Shore, N.Y. : Selchow & Righter, c1966
Description: “Game which introduces girls 8-13 to the careers of teacher, ballerina, nurse, model, actress, and airline stewardess.”

Woman & man the classic confrontation. 1971 
"Developed by Psychology Today to draw attention to "the way one sex has managed to squelch the other," the game aims to correct this blind spot. Men are encouraged to play the game as a woman and "feel what it's like to be a mere female to compete in a frustrating world that caters to men." But women are also encouraged to change roles and "get a taste of male supremacy, and compete with the sweet certainty that the world is made in a male image." --description from The Book Shop LLC

The rainbow gayme. 1992

Gayopoly 1981

Location for Installation:
Miami Law The Hilarie Bass Bricks: Live game
Alma Jennings Foundation Student Lounge: Signage, game tables, 2D videos

The installation focus is a life size boardgame where the viewers can participate as the game pieces. The initial game will run through a scripted round of the game performed by actors and/or the audience. At the start of the performance a brief description of social justice will be provided, followed by a description of the game theme and rules. (at this time viewers will be invited to participate in the initial game and will be provided a script to play along)

Additional Interactives wish list:
-Tablets with 2D videos of Social Justice games from the Kislak Collection. A written and audio narration is to be included with a brief description of each game. Tablets will include headsets for listening to not disturb other attendees.
-An App may be developed which can provide the same 2D experience on individuals’ phones and tables. The app can also provide a way to play the life size game setup on the bricks.
-Display cases with the Kislak’s collection of Social Justice Games for viewing.
-Boardgame table and seating setups for the audience to play
