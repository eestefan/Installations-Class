# Reflections - Kislak Center at the University of Miami

Visited May 30, 2019.

This visit was focused on what it takes to put together an installation and key tactics for success. Many thanks to Cristina and Arthur for the tour and sharing their expertise with us.

This Kislak Center is the home of the special collections at the University of Miami. https://www.library.miami.edu/kislak-center/about.html

Upon entering the beautiful contemporary space on the second floor of the Kislak, it is clear much time and care was taken in the curation. Much effort, planning and cost goes into the curation, thus the exhibition will remain on view for some time.

The overall space is clutter free, clean simple lines with contemporary fixtures and white walls. And while spacious, there is still a sense of intimacy. 

We start moving through the room and one of our first lessons is on arrangement, the need to arrange the space (the objects, furniture, art) in a manner that guides the visitor through the installation. Lead the eye, create the way, and create the journey. 

Eventually we approach a central area for pause. This we are told is called the landing area. It provides the audience with a view of the whole space. And from here, one can decide which way to go next. And again, the eye is led on the next part of the journey. 

Glass cases protect the art which is arranged at different levels for visual interest. Some pieces are on pedestals while others are hung at eye level. While the space has unideal low ceilings and lighting difficult to setup, the space has been dressed as best possible. Track lighting is used above works to illuminate, but care was needed in the process to make sure to reduce glare and shadows on the works.

Generally, installations can be arranged chronologically or thematically. Either way, there should be an overall unifying theme. It is about storytelling and creating a conversation between the viewer and artwork. And rather than giving a point of view, allow the audience to make their own conclusion. 

Additionally, offering interactive experiences is becoming more desirable and on the rise. The Kislak has digital touch screens offering different educational experiences. One is a multilingual audio flipbook, and another is a table with maps and descriptions though technically a little buggy. 

Overall, the success of an installation is a combination of not only the artwork, but also the physical space and what it offers the audience.
