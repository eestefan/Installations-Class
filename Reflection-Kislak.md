# Reflections - Kislak Center at the University of Miami

Visited May 30, 2019.

This reflection is focused on what I learned about putting together an installation from the staff at the Kislak during my visit. Many thanks to Cristina and Arthur for the tour and sharing their expertise with us.

This Kislak Center is the home of the special collections at the Unversity of Miami.
